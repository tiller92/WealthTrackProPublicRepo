#  Wealth Tracker Pro

### Goals
        1. To aid the average person in making educated financial decisions
        2. Be the most accurate net worth calculator on the internet

### Tech
    This is a Next JS build with Tailwind to style. It uses the Alphavatage API 
    as its main data resource. As it is the beta I have not gotten on the paid plan 
    so this limits requests. Once out of Beta I will upgrade to a higher tier. 

### Todo's 
    1. move over to anohter PG hosting platform. Heroku free tier will no longer be an option.
    2. reduce/ optimize calls to Alphavantage.
    3. create some logic that helps the dev to production, mostly in the package.JSON file
    4. add projected value feature (i.e roi times, years, additional contributions)
    5. prompt a guest user to change their username, password and email
